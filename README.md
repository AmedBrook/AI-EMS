AI-EMS
==============================

Intelligent Energy Managment System based on a model developed using AI/ML techniques.



Project's title.
=================

Smarti-act : AI-based Energy Management System (AI-EMS). 


Project's description and context. 
===============================


The project aims to come up with a solution to well manage the energy usage inside an industrial environemnt where there is a high requirement for energy availability to keep the production lines runing especially for the critical industries that are essenitial for human life like medicines and food manufacutring. We already know that companies while trying to fill the market demande they can consume a lot of energy that sometimes don't need, and because companies don't have the mecanismes to control their needs in term of energy especially on blackout periods, therefore, this ends up with a down time for them when the power source are fluctuating or unavailable for whatever reason. The IEMS systems can play an important role in this area of application to managage the energy flow durant this critical situations. 




Project's case usage.
====================

This project will bring to the light to one possible solution of an IEMS using Machine Learnig techniques, this case is related to optimize and rationalize energy consumption for companies during the blackout periods when the principal power resources are down and alternative resources are very limitted.
