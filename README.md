Smarti-act : AI-based Energy Management System (EMS) 


Project's description and context. 
===============================


The project aims to come up with a solution to well manage the energy usage inside a an industrial environnemnt where there is a high requiremnts for energy availability to keep the manufacuring lines runing especially for the crtical industries that are essenitial for human life like medicines and food manufacutring. We already know that companies while trying to fill the market demande they can consume a lot of energy that sometimes don't need, and beacause compnaies don't have the mecanismes to control their needs in term of energy, therefore, this ends up with a down time for them when the power source are fluctuating or unavailable for whatever reason. The IEMS systems can play an important role in this area and can fil the gap in most of the time accuarately. 




Project's case usage.
====================

This porject will bring to the light one possible solution of an IEMS using Machine Learnig algorithmes, this case is related to optimize and rationalize the energy consumption for companies during the blackout periods where the principal power resources are down and alternative reseources are very limitted.
